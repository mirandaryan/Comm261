        <p>We are the Fargo Public Schools FIRST Robotics Competition Team.  Every season, we build a brand new robot to compete against other high school teams in a game that changes from year-to-year.</p>

        <h2>About First Robotics</h2>
        <p>
            Combining the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. We call FIRST Robotics Competition the ultimate Sport for the Mind. High-school student participants call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”

            Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an exciting FIRST Championship.
        </p>
        <blockquote>"FIRST is more than just robots. The robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to expect - of the program nor of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they can create their own future."<br />-Dean Kamen (Founder of First)</blockquote>
